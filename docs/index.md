Java2Script provides an Eclipse Java to JavaScript transpiler 
(source-to-source compiler) and a nearly complete JavaScript implementation of 
the Java runtime environment (including AWT and Swing).

# About Java2Script

Java2Script is an integrated development system that allows interactive 
Java-to-JavaScript conversion within Eclipse, with immediate JavaScript testing 
and debugging in a browser, based on code developed in Java. 

After installing the Java2Script Eclipse plug-in ("drop-in"), Eclipse creates
both Java `.class` files and their equivalent `.js` files simultaneously. 
Together with a included JavaScript version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
this allows the rapid and automated production of browser-ready JavaScript 
versions of Java applications and applets.
